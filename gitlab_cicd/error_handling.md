# Error Handling & Retry in CI/CD

Error handling and retry mechanisms are essential for ensuring a smooth **CI/CD pipeline** execution. This section explores strategies for dealing with failures, automatic retries, and conditional pipeline steps using GitLab CI/CD.

## 1. **Fail Fast Strategy**

The "fail fast" strategy ensures that the pipeline stops as soon as an error occurs in one of the stages or jobs. This is useful for quickly identifying and addressing issues rather than waiting for multiple stages to run and fail.

### Fail Fast in GitLab CI/CD

By default, GitLab will fail the entire pipeline if any job fails, but you can fine-tune this behavior by using job dependencies and setting `allow_failure: false`.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  script:
    - make build

test:
  script:
    - make test
  # If test fails, the pipeline stops immediately
  allow_failure: false

deploy:
  script:
    - make deploy
```

### Key Points:
- If the `test` job fails, the `deploy` job won't run because GitLab will stop the pipeline (fail fast).
- The pipeline will halt at the first failure.

## 2. **Retry Mechanism**

Retrying failed jobs can be helpful in case of transient errors like network issues, temporary server unavailability, or third-party service downtime. You can configure a job to automatically retry a failed step a specified number of times.

### Configuring Retry in GitLab CI/CD

You can set the number of retries for a job using the `retry` keyword.

```yaml
test:
  script:
    - make test
  retry: 3   # Retry the job up to 3 times if it fails
```

### Key Points:
- If the `test` job fails, GitLab will retry it up to 3 times before marking it as failed permanently.
- This is useful for jobs that might fail intermittently, such as those involving external resources or services.

## 3. **Allow Failure**

In some cases, you may want a job to fail without affecting the pipeline's overall success. This is useful when the job is non-critical, or you're experimenting with a new feature that you expect to fail at times.

### Configuring `allow_failure`

The `allow_failure` keyword allows a job to fail without marking the pipeline as failed. The pipeline will continue to the next job even if the current one fails.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  script:
    - make build

test:
  script:
    - make test
  allow_failure: true   # The pipeline continues even if the test job fails

deploy:
  script:
    - make deploy
```

### Key Points:
- The `test` job is allowed to fail, and the pipeline will continue to the `deploy` job, even if the tests fail.
- Use `allow_failure: true` when the job isn't critical to the overall success of the pipeline.

## 4. **Manual Jobs (`when: manual`)**

In some scenarios, you may want to trigger certain jobs manually instead of automatically. This is useful for jobs like deployment, where you might want an extra layer of control before pushing code to production.

### Configuring Manual Jobs

You can use the `when: manual` keyword to specify that a job should only run when manually triggered by a user.

```yaml
deploy_to_production:
  script:
    - make deploy
  when: manual   # The deployment will only run when manually triggered
```

### Key Points:
- The `deploy_to_production` job will not run automatically; it requires someone to click "Run" in the GitLab UI.
- This is ideal for deployment jobs, where you want human oversight before pushing to production.

## 5. **Conditional Job Dependencies (`needs:optional`)**

In a pipeline, some jobs may not be critical to others, and you might want to continue running the pipeline even if these jobs fail. The `needs:optional` keyword allows jobs to be optional dependencies.

### Configuring Optional Dependencies with `needs:optional`

If a job fails but doesnâ€™t block subsequent jobs, you can use `needs:optional` to continue running the pipeline.

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  script:
    - make build

test:
  script:
    - make test

deploy:
  script:
    - make deploy
  needs:
    - job: test
      optional: true  # Deploy runs even if the test job fails
```

### Key Points:
- The `deploy` job will run regardless of the success or failure of the `test` job.
- Use `needs:optional` when the job doesn't affect subsequent steps in the pipeline, but you want to execute it even if a prior job fails.

## 6. **Summary of Keywords**

| **Keyword**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allow_failure`      | Allows a job to fail without affecting the overall pipeline status.              |
| `retry`             | Specifies how many times a job should retry if it fails.                        |
| `when: manual`       | Defines a job that must be manually triggered to run.                           |
| `needs: optional`    | Allows jobs to run even if a prior job fails (optional dependency).             |

## Example GitLab CI/CD Configuration

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  script:
    - make build

test:
  script:
    - make test
  retry: 2   # Retry the job up to 2 times
  allow_failure: false  # Fail fast if the test fails

deploy:
  script:
    - make deploy
  when: manual   # Deployment must be triggered manually
  needs:
    - job: test
      optional: true  # Deploy runs even if the test fails
```

### Key Points in the Example:
- The pipeline will **fail fast** if the `test` job fails and does not allow it to proceed to deployment.
- The `deploy` job requires manual intervention to run, and it will run regardless of the `test` job's result if the `test` job is marked as optional.

### Conclusion

Effective **error handling** and **retry mechanisms** in your **CI/CD pipeline** are crucial for managing failures and ensuring reliable deployments. By using GitLab CI/CD's powerful features like **fail fast**, **retry**, **allow_failure**, **when: manual**, and **needs: optional**, you can build robust, efficient pipelines that handle errors gracefully and provide control over critical deployment steps.
